Hey, thanks for stopping by! 

Hi, I am Qiang Wang, an Algorithm Expert at [RoyalFlush AI](http://www.aicubes.cn/api/public/aiInstitute.html). My research interests are mainly in **machine translation** and **deep learning**.

Before joining RoyalFlush, I worked as Senior Algorithm Engineer at Alibaba DAMO Academic. I completed my PhD from [Natural Language Processing Laboratory at Northeastern University](https://www.nlplab.com/), where I was co-advised by Prof. [Jingbo Zhu](https://www.nlplab.com/members/zhujingbo.html) and Prof. [Tong Xiao](https://www.nlplab.com/members/xiaotong.html).
